Description
-
Project realised in the course **Projet et Methode** in our 3rd year of Electronic and Computer Science course at the INSA Rennes.
This program corresponds to the **game engine of an escape game**.
The **game engine** follows the functioning of a state's machine and the **graphic interface** was made using the SDL2 library.
Coding files are seperated in **4 categories** : Model, View, Controller and Test (for the "tests unitaires") according to the **MVC program structure**.
Compiling creates all the `.a` files of a static library in a specific `'lib'` file that is then called in the `main.c` file when launching the program.
